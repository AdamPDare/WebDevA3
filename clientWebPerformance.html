                    <h3>Users Choice of Device</h3>
                    <p>
                        Users have a wide range of devices they can choose from; all of
                        these will be varying in hardware and software specifications, so it 
                        is important to optimise the website, to use as little 
                        resources as possible whilst performing well.

                        Compare portable device to computer

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Increasingly websites are viewed upon mobile devices, which 
                        have different operating systems and potentially web-browsers 
                        from a computer; therefore require websites to be adaptable
                        to facillitate these and all content can be displayed.
                         Furthermore, mobile hardware tends to be less powerful, when 
                         compared to a desktop, so the website needs to be efficient in the resources it uses 
                        to ensure the user experience is up to par. However, if this
                        does not happen, the website will perform poorly, with long 
                        loading times; if the website is not reactive, not all the content 
                        will be displayed upon mobile devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the contrary, computers will require a less reactive website 
                        but will still require optimisation, especially for older hardware
                        and software. However, for all devices the web-browsers do have 
                        add on features to boost the performance of webpages such as: flash player.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Hardware Specification of Device</h3>
                    <p>
                        
                        The speed at which the full website does load upon to the user/ client's 
                        screen will be dictated by the user's hardware. The main restricting
                        factors of this will be the CPU and RAM clock speeds as well as the 
                        RAMs capacity. So the higher the clock speed, the quicker the loading times
                        and the higher the RAM capacity and the more CPU cores the better at 
                        multi-tasking the device will be. So, if someone has an old device, typically
                        the loading time will be longer.

                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Choice of Web-Browser</h3>
                    <p>
                        The users choice of web-browser does affect the load times 
                        / performance of the website, as each web-browser will have slightly
                        different or outdated features that will contribute to the loading
                        times of the website, for example: flash player. Normally these features
                        are designed to improve the performance of websites on every device, but 
                        outdated version will be slower than the latest ones. Furthermore, all the web-browsers should have 
                        all the compatibility required for the website. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each web-browser will also use different amounts of the CPU, RAM and 
                        storage space upon the device. Depending on how much could cause the 
                        device to be incredibly slow, and inherently cause the website performance 
                        to decrease. However, on newer devices this does not occur; web-browsers 
                        have become more efficient resource usage; therefore the websites perform better. Google is the most popular
                        search engine currently.
