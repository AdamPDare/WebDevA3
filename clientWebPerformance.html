                    <h3>Users Choice of Device</h3>
                    <p>
                        Users have a wide range of devices they can choose from; all of
                        these will be varying in hardware and software specifications, so it 
                        is important to optimise the website, to use as little 
                        resources as possible whilst performing well.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Increasingly websites are viewed upon mobile devices, which 
                        have different operating systems and potentially web-browsers 
                        from a computer; therefore require websites to be adaptable
                        to facillitate these and all the content can be displayed.
                         Furthermore, mobile hardware tends to be less powerful, when 
                         compared to a desktop, so the website needs to be efficient in the resources it uses 
                        to ensure the user experience is up to par. However, if this
                        does not happen, the website will perform poorly, with long 
                        loading times; if the website is not reactive, not all the content 
                        will be displayed upon mobile devices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On the contrary, computers will require a less reactive website 
                        but will still require optimisation, especially for older hardware
                        and software. However, for all devices the web-browsers do have 
                        add on features to boost the performance of webpages such as: flash player.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Hardware Specification of Device</h3>
                    <p>
                        
                        The speed at which the full website does load upon to the user/ client's 
                        screen will be dictated by the user's hardware. The main restricting
                        factors of this will be the CPU and RAM clock speeds as well as the 
                        RAMs capacity. So the higher the clock speed, the quicker the loading times
                        and the higher the RAM capacity and the more CPU cores the better at 
                        multi-tasking the device will be. So, if someone has an old device, typically
                        the loading time will be longer.

                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Choice of Web-Browser</h3>
                    <p>
                        The users choice of web-browser does affect the load times 
                        / performance of the website, as each web-browser will have slightly
                        different or outdated features that will contribute to the loading
                        times of the website, for example: flash player. Normally these features
                        are designed to improve the performance of websites on every device, but 
                        outdated version will be slower than the latest ones. Furthermore, all the web-browsers should have 
                        all the compatibility required for the website. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each web-browser will also use different amounts of the CPU, RAM and 
                        storage space upon the device. Depending on how much could cause the 
                        device to be incredibly slow, and inherently cause the website performance 
                        to decrease. However, on newer devices this does not occur; web-browsers 
                        have become more efficient resource usage; therefore the websites perform better. Google is the most popular
                        search engine currently.

                    <h2>Factors that affect server website performance</h2>
                    <h3>Web Server Capacity</h3>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <h3>File size/ Types</h3>
                    <p>
                        On a website, normally, the larger the file size or the more files 
                        you want to add the longer the website will take to load. So it is 
                        important to optimise the files and the website, and potentially 
                        compress the files. This can be done via lossless or lossy compression,
                        though lossy compression will reduce the image quality or remove data from the File
                        completely.

                    <p>
                        Bitmap images are made up of several pixels; each colour of each pixel is 
                        represented by a binary number, for example: white is 0 and black is 1. The 
                        number of colours available in the image depend how many bits the binary 
                        number is. To increase the number of colours and shades, you will need to 
                        increase the number of bits available to the pixel. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you want to improve the quality of the image, you must increase the colour 
                        depth and resolution of the image. This in turn will also increase the file 
                        size, due to their being more pixels, colours and bits per pixel. This makes 
                        it important to compress the file via lossless compression to ensure the File
                        size is reduced, but the quality is the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Vector images/ graphics are based upon mathematical equations or commands to 
                        create lines, points (start and end) and curves to a 2d or 3d space. These 
                        spaces will also have a co-ordinate reference, so when an image is shrunk or 
                        enlarged, the shapes will remain in the same space and the image will not lose 
                        any quality. This therefore causes vector images to be of higher quality than
                        bitmap ones, but have a large file size, which in turn will cause a website to 
                        load slower.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Available Bandwidth</h3>
                    <p>
                        Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be transferred at the same time, 
                        so the higher the bandwidth of the clients internet connection, the more 
                        data that can be sent between the client's device and the server. This 
                        therefore means the website will perform better and loading times will be
                        far quicker than someone with a low bandwidth, as the server can send and receive the 
                        necessary data at a quicker rate. However, websites can be optimised as 
                        well for someone with a lower bandwidth to ensure that they do load within 
                        3 seconds as users invariably will click off the website if it doesnt load 
                        by then. This is why most of the top websites are at the top, because they
                        are optimised for people with varying amounts of bandwidth.
