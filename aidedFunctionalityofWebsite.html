                    <p>
                        User redirection is essential to a website with multiple webpages
                        to enable the user to view the content of the whole website, via 
                        a navigation bar or links. If there was not user redirection, users 
                        would only be able to view the homepage of the website or be redirected
                        to other websites if necessary.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Browser Detection</h2>
                    <p>
                        Browser Detection will be used to see which browser is mainly used to view your 
                        website; this information could be used to decide what optimisations and ehancements
                        are made to the website, depending upon the browser. For example: the website detects
                        a mobile browser, therefore a mobile optimised version of the website will be sent 
                        to the device. This means that each user will have the best user experience of the website
                        according the their browser. Furthermore,  there may also be compatibility issues with certain lines
                        of code for each browser or they do not work as intended, so detecting the browser maybe 
                        necessary to avoid this and send a different version of the website. So, browser 
                        detection aids functionality via deciding which version of a website should be sent to the user 
                        to offer them the best user experience available.
