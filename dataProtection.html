                    <h2>Data Protection Act 1984, 1998 and 2000</h2>
                    <p>
                        The data protection act was designed to protect the privacy and integrity of all the personal data and information stored upon any computer or any paper filing systems by an organisation. This data associated with an individual must be able to accessible to them and if they need to correct it, they can do so. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>The 8 principles in the DPA</h3>
                    <p>
                            1.	Personal Data must be processed fairly and lawfully.
                            Individuals must be informed upon the purpose of why the data is being collected and whether the information will be sent out of the European Economic Area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.	Data can only be used for the purposes for which it was collected.
                        The data being collected can only be used for one purpose; these purposes must be legal and reasonable
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.	The data collected must be relevant, adequate and must not be excessive
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.	The data must be accurate and kept up to date
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5.	Data cannot be held for longer than needed
                        A retention policy could be enforced to extend the duration of which the data is kept for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.	The data must be processed according to the rights of the individual
                        Provide individuals with a version of the data that has been collected upon them. This must be done within 40 days if the user has requested to view this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7.	Technical and organisational measures need to be put in place to protect the confidentiality of the data.
                            Protect the data from hackers/ malicious software and unauthorised access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8.	Data cannot be transferred out of the European Economic Area unless it is accurate, and measures have been put in place to protect it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is an exemption to this, if the individual’s data is being processed to prevent and detect a crime, a fair processing notice will not need to be provided. Allowing law enforcement agencies view this personal data tends to be acceptable, only if a formal procedure is followed and the request for this information was reasonable; the response did not provide them with an excessive amount of information upon that individual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If there has been a breach of the Data protection Act the Information Commissioner has the power to enforce large fines of up to £500,000 to an organisation. Furthermore, individuals who believe their information has been misused can complain and can start legal proceedings; then decide whether the company has taken enough security measures to protect the information.

                    <h3>Affect of DPA on organisations</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Data Protection Act was put in place to protect personal information that has been collected and stored by companies upon their customers. The act forces companies to put adequate security measures in place, to prevent any data leaks or unauthorised access from occurring. Furthermore, it forces companies to also put further measures in place to ensure that is the data is being shared elsewhere, no one can intercept it and would struggle to bypass the measures or wouldn’t be able to breach them. This in theory should mean that individual’s personal information is kept confidential and should only be viewed by authorised people. Because of this, it will increase the companies costs overall, as to keep up with new forms of attacks and maintain confidentiality, the security measures are awfully expensive. Therefore, some companies cannot afford the latest security measures, which can cause data leaks to occur as they are susceptible to the new attacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a data leak does occur, a company is likely to receive a fine from the DPA Information commissioner of up to£500,000 in most cases, or certain employees will receive jail time. This compensates individuals for the damage and distress the information leak has caused them. The company must pay the fine and then put the adequate security measures in place, as otherwise they risk another data leak from occurring and another fine. Therefore, this will increase the company’s outgoings for that year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, the DPA affects organisations via individuals having the ability to request to view the information they have stored about them. This means that the organisation must provide the information they have upon the customer and allows them to see whether it is alright for the company to keep and use this information, or whether they feel it is excessive and want to file a complaint or have it deleted. An organisation must be compliant to an individual request about their own information and provide it to them within 40 days.

                    <h2>Disaster Recovery Policy/ plan</h2>
                    <p>
                        Disaster Recovery is a type of security planning or procedure that aims to protect an organisation from the consequences of major negative situations, such as data loss. Furthermore, this method of planning allows a company not to become completely disrupted by the situation, so they can continue the company’s main function. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Disaster recovery can be for various events:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Equipment failure
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Power outages
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Cyber attacks
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Criminals or military attacks
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Natural Disasters
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Civil emergencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Disaster Recovery Policies focus upon supporting the critical functions of an organisation and recovering the essential parts for that business. Furthermore, this then mitigates the impacts of disaster, allowing the company to still function at a basic level. Also, the policy set out a method to recovering from disasters in the most efficient way possible.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Every Recovery policy should include:</h3>
                    <p>
                        •	An inventory of Assets and Services – All the organisations assets should be listed and put in an order of priority. This must include software and hardware; having this list causes the most important assets to be recovered first.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Data and Backups – An organisation must always backup their data and test it regularly. This policy should state where all the critical data for the company is stored and what data type it is. This will then speed up the recovery process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Predict and Determine possible disasters – In the policy is should include a procedure to counter every possible disaster or for ones that are likely to occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Specify what action the Disaster Recovery team should take– The people within this team should understand the policy and the procedure to then minimise the impacts of this disaster upon the company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Offsite Location – If the location of the company is destroyed is must specify any offsite locations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Emergency Contact List – this includes phone numbers, names, and email addresses. This should also include third party vendors, who sold software and hardware to the company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Regular Testing and Updates – Every recovery policy should be updates and test frequently to ensure that it is viable; the company can recover from it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, there are also different levels of disaster recovery capability. This includes 3 tiers of system:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Tier 1 – critical systems
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Tier 2- Other non-critical systems
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Tier 3- Not an IT Incident.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These tiers are used to determine the type of disaster recovery a company should use, for example: Tier 1 tells the employees to focus upon backing up the critical systems and the company’s basic function.

                    <h3>General Data Protection Register</h3>
                    <p>
                        GDPR was enforced on the 25th May 2015 in the EU states (DPA is only in the UK); this was created to modernise the current laws to protect individual’s personal information (modernise the data protection laws). The data protection laws did struggle to keep up with technological advancements and GDPR was implemented to change how organisations and PAs can handle individuals and customers information. Furthermore, this act allows individuals to have more control over the information a company stores about them. Lastly, this act was implemented to create a consistent law to protect individual’s privacy and data across Europe and empower individuals to complain if they were violated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These acts are very similar, and both protect personal information that is held and used about individuals. Below are the main differences between GDPR and DPA:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.	GDPR only allows a child to consent to any forms of data processing at the age of 16, the DPA states this at 13 years old
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.	GDPR states that within an “Identifier” there must be an IP address, internet cook-ies and DNA in the personal data 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.	GDPR only allows criminal data processing if there is consent from an official au-thority
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.	Individuals can choose whether they want to be subjected/ allow to automated decision marking or profiling
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5.	All individuals have the rights in connection with the way their data is processed, whereas DPA allows companies to ignore these rights if compliance will severely and negatively hinder the company and how they operate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Data Protection Act covers a wider range of how data is processed and used by companies as well as how it is transported outside of the EU. However, because of GDPR it allows data to be able to be transported within EU states unhindered; with the UK leaving the EU this will change. If the UK wants information and data to be shared, they will need to ensure their data protection laws are like the GPR.

                    <h2>Data Protection methods</h2>
                    <h3>Virus Guard</h3>
                    <p>
                        Virus checking software, aka Anti-virus, 
                        is a software program that is designed to detect, isolate, neutralise and 
                        destroy established malicious software that if finds upon a device. 
                        It does this via Real Time Protection to check the computer for any abnormal 
                        activity, especially when something is being installed and scanning any 
                        network data; block any that could be a threat. Virus checking software 
                        will scan the computer regularly and compare all the files to the known 
                        types of malicious software.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Virus checking software must be installed onto a computer by the user, 
                        or it comes built into the operating system to prevent any malicious software 
                        from acquiring access to your device or network. It helps combat any more 
                        files becoming encrypted, modified, or deleted via isolating it into a specific 
                        place; then if it can destroy it. This means that if a user does have 
                        malicious code upon their device not everything is lost unless the software 
                        or the actual user cannot combat it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Firewall</h3>
                    <p>
                        A firewall is a system that was designed to monitor, filter; protect network 
                        traffic and connections, via filtering outgoing and incoming packets or 
                        information upon the network you are a part of. A firewall will filter 
                        out any information or packets if they do not meet the network policies 
                        and security; will prevent them from entering or leaving the network to 
                        their intended destination. This allows administrators to restrict certain 
                        services and websites from being used while upon the network.

                        A firewall can be used to prevent unauthorised access upon a network; are 
                        configured to prevent logins from unauthenticated users. This then enables 
                        the information upon the network to remain private and secure from these 
                        people. Furthermore, it will prevent any of this information being modified 
                        or deleted to maintain data integrity and a high level of accuracy.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Two Main types of Firewall</h4>
                    <h4>Hardware</h4>
                    <p>
                        A hardware firewall is a physical device that will analyse all the 
                        incoming packets/ information coming from the internet; block any 
                        dangerous packets or packets that do not meet the network policies. 
                        This is done before they enter the network and reach the specific device.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Software</h4>
                    <p>
                        A software firewall is installed onto a secondary storage medium of your 
                        device and prevents any risky activities from occurring on your PC 
                        (depending upon the policies put in place), but the packets will have 
                        passed through the network, router and reached your device.
                    </p>


                    <h3>Encryption</h3>
                    <p>
                        Encryption is the method of converting plain text into cipher text, using an algorithm. The algorithm will scramble/ encrypt the plain text/ data using a unique key. The only way a recipient can read/ view the true contents of the file or text, they will have to use the key to decrypt it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To encrypt a data file, it is done by several bits for each section that is encrypted. The maximum number of bits that can be used is 256-bits and that gives 2^256 possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are various encryption techniques to secure the contents of a file or make some text unreadable to any unauthorised people. The most common Encryption methods are:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Advanced Encryption Standard: This type of encryption uses an algorithm that will encrypt sections of data (128 bits) at a time. This type of encryption can be decrypted via a 128,192 or a 256-bit key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Rivest Shamir Adleman: The RSA uses an algorithm that revolves around the factorisation of the products from two large prime numbers. This type of encryption can only be decrypted via knowing these two prime numbers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Triple Data Encryption Standard: Normal Data Encryption Standard uses a 56-bit key to encrypt data. TDES uses DES but encrypts each section of the data three times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Twofish: A licence free encryption technique that will encrypt the data sections via 128-bit encryption.
