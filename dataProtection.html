                    <p>
                        The data protection act was designed to protect the privacy and integrity of all the personal data and information stored upon any computer or any paper filing systems by an organisation. This data associated with an individual must be able to accessible to them and if they need to correct it, they can do so. 
                    </p>
                    <h3>The 8 principles in the DPA</h3>
                    <p>
                            1.	Personal Data must be processed fairly and lawfully.
                            Individuals must be informed upon the purpose of why the data is being collected and whether the information will be sent out of the European Economic Area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.	Data can only be used for the purposes for which it was collected.
                        The data being collected can only be used for one purpose; these purposes must be legal and reasonable
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.	The data collected must be relevant, adequate and must not be excessive
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.	The data must be accurate and kept up to date
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5.	Data cannot be held for longer than needed
                        A retention policy could be enforced to extend the duration of which the data is kept for.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6.	The data must be processed according to the rights of the individual
                        Provide individuals with a version of the data that has been collected upon them. This must be done within 40 days if the user has requested to view this.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7.	Technical and organisational measures need to be put in place to protect the confidentiality of the data.
                            Protect the data from hackers/ malicious software and unauthorised access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8.	Data cannot be transferred out of the European Economic Area unless it is accurate, and measures have been put in place to protect it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There is an exemption to this, if the individual’s data is being processed to prevent and detect a crime, a fair processing notice will not need to be provided. Allowing law enforcement agencies view this personal data tends to be acceptable, only if a formal procedure is followed and the request for this information was reasonable; the response did not provide them with an excessive amount of information upon that individual.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If there has been a breach of the Data protection Act the Information Commissioner has the power to enforce large fines of up to £500,000 to an organisation. Furthermore, individuals who believe their information has been misused can complain and can start legal proceedings; then decide whether the company has taken enough security measures to protect the information.

                    <h3>Affect of DPA on organisations</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Data Protection Act was put in place to protect personal information that has been collected and stored by companies upon their customers. The act forces companies to put adequate security measures in place, to prevent any data leaks or unauthorised access from occurring. Furthermore, it forces companies to also put further measures in place to ensure that is the data is being shared elsewhere, no one can intercept it and would struggle to bypass the measures or wouldn’t be able to breach them. This in theory should mean that individual’s personal information is kept confidential and should only be viewed by authorised people. Because of this, it will increase the companies costs overall, as to keep up with new forms of attacks and maintain confidentiality, the security measures are awfully expensive. Therefore, some companies cannot afford the latest security measures, which can cause data leaks to occur as they are susceptible to the new attacks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If a data leak does occur, a company is likely to receive a fine from the DPA Information commissioner of up to£500,000 in most cases, or certain employees will receive jail time. This compensates individuals for the damage and distress the information leak has caused them. The company must pay the fine and then put the adequate security measures in place, as otherwise they risk another data leak from occurring and another fine. Therefore, this will increase the company’s outgoings for that year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, the DPA affects organisations via individuals having the ability to request to view the information they have stored about them. This means that the organisation must provide the information they have upon the customer and allows them to see whether it is alright for the company to keep and use this information, or whether they feel it is excessive and want to file a complaint or have it deleted. An organisation must be compliant to an individual request about their own information and provide it to them within 40 days.

                    <h3>General Data Protection Register</h3>
                    <p>
                        GDPR was enforced on the 25th May 2015 in the EU states (DPA is only in the UK); this was created to modernise the current laws to protect individual’s personal information (modernise the data protection laws). The data protection laws did struggle to keep up with technological advancements and GDPR was implemented to change how organisations and PAs can handle individuals and customers information. Furthermore, this act allows individuals to have more control over the information a company stores about them. Lastly, this act was implemented to create a consistent law to protect individual’s privacy and data across Europe and empower individuals to complain if they were violated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These acts are very similar, and both protect personal information that is held and used about individuals. Below are the main differences between GDPR and DPA:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.	GDPR only allows a child to consent to any forms of data processing at the age of 16, the DPA states this at 13 years old
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.	GDPR states that within an “Identifier” there must be an IP address, internet cook-ies and DNA in the personal data 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.	GDPR only allows criminal data processing if there is consent from an official au-thority
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4.	Individuals can choose whether they want to be subjected/ allow to automated decision marking or profiling
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5.	All individuals have the rights in connection with the way their data is processed, whereas DPA allows companies to ignore these rights if compliance will severely and negatively hinder the company and how they operate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Data Protection Act covers a wider range of how data is processed and used by companies as well as how it is transported outside of the EU. However, because of GDPR it allows data to be able to be transported within EU states unhindered; with the UK leaving the EU this will change. If the UK wants information and data to be shared, they will need to ensure their data protection laws are like the GPR.
