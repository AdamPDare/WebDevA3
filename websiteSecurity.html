                    <h2>Types of attack upon a system</h2>
                    <h3>Malware</h3>
                    <p>
                        Malicious Software (malware) is a generic term for 
                        viruses, worms, trojans and various other programs or
                        scripts that will cause harm to a computer or gain
                        unauthorised access to sensitive information. Malware 
                        is identified via its intended use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Malware tends to acquire access to a system via 
                        attaching themselves to files mainly .exe files or
                        autorun scripts.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Viruses</h4>
                    <p>
                        Viruses are spread via the user copying the infected 
                        file and activating them when they are opened.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Worms</h4>
                    <p>
                        Worms are self-replicating and will spread incredibly 
                        quickly on the computer. Worms exploit the weaknesses in 
                        network security.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Trojans</h4>
                    <p>
                        Trojans are malware that is disguised as legitimate software; 
                        are installed by the user. They always have a hidden purpose and 
                        tend to run in the background.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Logic bombs</h4>
                    <p>
                        Logic Bombs is malicious code that was created to cause harm 
                        to a specific network, when an event occurs or when certain 
                        conditions have been met, the code is then executed. For example:
                        an event could be a specific time or date.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The amount of damage caused by a logic bomb does vary, but normally
                        it causes data corruption, deletion, editing or even wiping hard drives.

                    <h2>Main Protection Mechanisms</h2>
                    <h3>Virus Guard</h3>
                    <p>
                        Virus checking software, aka Anti-virus, 
                        is a software program that is designed to detect, isolate, neutralise and 
                        destroy established malicious software that if finds upon a device. 
                        It does this via Real Time Protection to check the computer for any abnormal 
                        activity, especially when something is being installed and scanning any 
                        network data; block any that could be a threat. Virus checking software 
                        will scan the computer regularly and compare all the files to the known 
                        types of malicious software.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Virus checking software must be installed onto a computer by the user, 
                        or it comes built into the operating system to prevent any malicious software 
                        from acquiring access to your device or network. It helps combat any more 
                        files becoming encrypted, modified, or deleted via isolating it into a specific 
                        place; then if it can destroy it. This means that if a user does have 
                        malicious code upon their device not everything is lost unless the software 
                        or the actual user cannot combat it.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Firewall</h3>
                    <p>
                        A firewall is a system that was designed to monitor, filter; protect network 
                        traffic and connections, via filtering outgoing and incoming packets or 
                        information upon the network you are a part of. A firewall will filter 
                        out any information or packets if they do not meet the network policies 
                        and security; will prevent them from entering or leaving the network to 
                        their intended destination. This allows administrators to restrict certain 
                        services and websites from being used while upon the network.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A firewall can be used to prevent unauthorised access upon a network; are 
                        configured to prevent logins from unauthenticated users. This then enables 
                        the information upon the network to remain private and secure from these 
                        people. Furthermore, it will prevent any of this information being modified 
                        or deleted to maintain data integrity and a high level of accuracy.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Two Main types of Firewall</h4>
                    <h4>Hardware</h4>
                    <p>
                        A hardware firewall is a physical device that will analyse all the 
                        incoming packets/ information coming from the internet; block any 
                        dangerous packets or packets that do not meet the network policies. 
                        This is done before they enter the network and reach the specific device.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Software</h4>
                    <p>
                        A software firewall is installed onto a secondary storage medium of your 
                        device and prevents any risky activities from occurring on your PC 
                        (depending upon the policies put in place), but the packets will have 
                        passed through the network, router and reached your device.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Configurations of Firewalls</h4>
                    <p>
                        •	Packet filtering: The firewall analyses each incoming and outgoing packet 
                        and will either accept or reject them depending upon the network rules 
                        and policies or the User’s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Circuit-level gateway implementation: This type of firewall will apply 
                        various security measures when a TCP (Transmission control protocol) or a UDP 
                        (User datagram protocol) connection becomes apparent.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Acting as a proxy server: Hides the network addresses of any computer or 
                        device that connects through it. This server requests the data and receives it 
                        instead of the devices and this server can only allow certain packets or 
                        information through.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Web application firewalls: WAF is a hardware device that can identify 
                        various attacks and can block them from occurring.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Most firewalls in a company will use a combination of both types of 
                        firewalls and the various configurations are combined to give a broader 
                        protection against attacks and dodgy websites etc. 
                    </p>
