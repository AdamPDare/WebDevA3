                    <h2>What are Objects and methods?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Objects are variables, but have the capabilites to store numerous values.
                        These values are seperated by a colon and normally follow this structure
                        Name/ property: Value. So, Objects can store a single value or a collection of them.
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Methods/ Object methods are various actions that are executed upon 
                        objects. A method must contain a function definition, to be different
                        to an object.

                    <h2>JS Security Issues</h2>
                    <h3>Source Code Vulnerabilities</h3>
                    <p>
                        Javascript has quite a number of security holes/ vulnerabilities
                        due to the programming language being interpreted rather than 
                        compiled. This means that unauthorised people/ hackers are able
                        to easily view and examine the source code of the application.
                        To slow down hackers attempts, the developers need to make the 
                        applications code obscure and unclear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another security issue is that Javascript utilises public packages
                        and libraries (mainly NPM) as they offer a large portion of these 
                        JS packages. NPM do offer a wide range of packages there is also 
                        the risk that their are a number of unknown vulnerabilities/ security
                        holes within them. Plus, most developers will install these packages
                        to complete simple tasks, therefore increasing a projects dependency
                        upon these packages, and increasing the risk for a security breach.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Unintended Script Execution (XSS)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unintended scripts can easily be executed, without the user
                        even knowing, due to the way JS does interact with DOMs upon 
                        a website/ webpage. This is because scripts can be embedded into 
                        these elements and then executed in the user's browser. Therefore,
                        the malicious code will be running as apart of the webpage.

                    </p>
                    <h3>Reliance upon Client Side Validation Alone</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hackers are able to bypass Client side validation, via sending
                        the data or tools straight to the server. This data invariably
                        will be malicious/ unverified and could cause corrupted or 
                        erroneous data to be stored upon the server.

                    <h2 style="color: purple;">Event Handling</h2>
                    <p>
                        Event handling is a process that will control how a program
                        or device will react or respond/ what will happen if a 
                        specific event does occur. The event handler will then only
                        executed if the event does occur.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Javascript can be used to create an Event handler, as it 
                        can be an Event driven programming language. The JS event 
                        handlers are normally used to deal with verifying user's
                        inputs, actions and also browser actions. This event handler 
                        could also be used to handle how the user interacts with 
                        HTML elements upon the webpage.
