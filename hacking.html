                    <h3>Encryption</h3>
                    <p>
                        Encryption is the method of converting plain text into cipher text, using an algorithm. The algorithm will scramble/ encrypt the plain text/ data using a unique key. The only way a recipient can read/ view the true contents of the file or text, they will have to use the key to decrypt it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To encrypt a data file, it is done by several bits for each section that is encrypted. The maximum number of bits that can be used is 256-bits and that gives 2^256 possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are various encryption techniques to secure the contents of a file or make some text unreadable to any unauthorised people. The most common Encryption methods are:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Advanced Encryption Standard: This type of encryption uses an algorithm that will encrypt sections of data (128 bits) at a time. This type of encryption can be decrypted via a 128,192 or a 256-bit key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Rivest Shamir Adleman: The RSA uses an algorithm that revolves around the factorisation of the products from two large prime numbers. This type of encryption can only be decrypted via knowing these two prime numbers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Triple Data Encryption Standard: Normal Data Encryption Standard uses a 56-bit key to encrypt data. TDES uses DES but encrypts each section of the data three times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Twofish: A licence free encryption technique that will encrypt the data sections via 128-bit encryption.

                    <h3>Intrusion Detection Systems</h3>
                    <p>
                        An Intrusion Detection System is either a device or some software in which will survey a network for any harmful activity anomalies or policy violations. The IDS will capture small amounts of data and send it back to the administrator; if a cyber-attack is detected, using real time protection, the IDS administrator is alerted. An IDS acts as an early warning system for known attacks upon a network; gives the administrator time to act and prevent the attack causing any damage to any of the files and the network.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An IDS also can detect harmful packets and will prevent them from entering the network and reaching their destination, like a firewall. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Passwords</h3>
                    <p>
                        A password is a string of letters, numbers and symbols that are used to authenticate and verify someone’s identity; enable that person to login to their account. Passwords are used to prove your identity such as: Email and social media accounts. It is necessary to have a strong password to protect your account from hackers and unauthorised people from accessing your account, so a password must contain:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Capital and lowercase letters
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Numbers
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Symbols
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Be at least 8 characters long
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	The password should have no link or reference back to you.
                    </p>
