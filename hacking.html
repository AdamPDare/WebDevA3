                    <h3>Encryption</h3>
                    <p>
                        Encryption is the method of converting plain text into cipher text, using an algorithm. The algorithm will scramble/ encrypt the plain text/ data using a unique key. The only way a recipient can read/ view the true contents of the file or text, they will have to use the key to decrypt it. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To encrypt a data file, it is done by several bits for each section that is encrypted. The maximum number of bits that can be used is 256-bits and that gives 2^256 possibilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are various encryption techniques to secure the contents of a file or make some text unreadable to any unauthorised people. The most common Encryption methods are:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Advanced Encryption Standard: This type of encryption uses an algorithm that will encrypt sections of data (128 bits) at a time. This type of encryption can be decrypted via a 128,192 or a 256-bit key.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Rivest Shamir Adleman: The RSA uses an algorithm that revolves around the factorisation of the products from two large prime numbers. This type of encryption can only be decrypted via knowing these two prime numbers.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Triple Data Encryption Standard: Normal Data Encryption Standard uses a 56-bit key to encrypt data. TDES uses DES but encrypts each section of the data three times.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Twofish: A licence free encryption technique that will encrypt the data sections via 128-bit encryption.

                    <h3>Intrusion Detection Systems</h3>
                    <p>
                        An Intrusion Detection System is either a device or some software in which will survey a network for any harmful activity anomalies or policy violations. The IDS will capture small amounts of data and send it back to the administrator; if a cyber-attack is detected, using real time protection, the IDS administrator is alerted. An IDS acts as an early warning system for known attacks upon a network; gives the administrator time to act and prevent the attack causing any damage to any of the files and the network.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An IDS also can detect harmful packets and will prevent them from entering the network and reaching their destination, like a firewall. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Passwords</h3>
                    <p>
                        A password is a string of letters, numbers and symbols that are used to authenticate and verify someone’s identity; enable that person to login to their account. Passwords are used to prove your identity such as: Email and social media accounts. It is necessary to have a strong password to protect your account from hackers and unauthorised people from accessing your account, so a password must contain:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Capital and lowercase letters
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Numbers
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Symbols
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Be at least 8 characters long
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	The password should have no link or reference back to you.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Keeping software up to date</h3>
                    <p>
                        A software update is a download for a piece of software which is intended to fix bugs, errors and security holes; make the user’s experience overall easier and better. Furthermore, it is meant to enhance the software further and give it greater capabilities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Keeping software up to date is especially important because with each update there will be patches to fix various security holes, errors and bugs and the software should have more capabilities with newer features. This allows a network to become safer and able to resist more of the up-and-coming forms of attacks as there will be less susceptible security holes upon the network. Also, with keeping software up to date it allows them to become more stable and less susceptible to various attacks. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Handshaking</h3>
                    <p>
                        Handshaking is the method of sending signals back and forth from one computer to another, to set up a connection across a network. There are two types of Handshake:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Software: Where codes are sent via Transmission control Protocol/ Internet protocol
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        •	Hardware: Use wires to request to send codes to the other device and clear to send these codes. It will then send a RS-232 serial transmission (standard protocol for serial communication).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Software Handshaking is a protocol which will control the data that is sent between devices and improve the overall process. Furthermore, using Software handshaking will make the communication between the two devices more secure as either a key or password will be required to open the data that has been sent. Also, only the recipient can view this data as it has been only sent to them.

                    <h2>Legislations</h2>
                    <h3>Computer Misuse Act</h3>
                    <p>
                        The Computer Misuse Act is a law put in place to protect personal data and information an organisation stores about their customers and people from all forms of unauthorised access. This causes companies and individuals to put adequate security systems and measures in place to protect this information or be subject to the act and its punishments. Also, the act, is meant to act as a deterrent to individuals who plan to acquire unauthorised access to computer material; force companies who do not have adequate security to invest in some.
                        This act also prevents the modification of data.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        What does the Computer Misuse Act make illegal?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1.	Unauthorised access to a computer system – hacking into a computer
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2.	Unauthorised access to any form of computer material and having the intent to commit any further crimes – entering a system to delete, edit or steal information
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3.	Unauthorised modification of information or data
                    </p>
                    <p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This act covers mainly these four offenses: hacking, computer fraud, blackmail and viruses/ malware. If someone or a company does not abide by this act, they could face fines and the possibility of going to prison. In the table below, it shows the possible penalties an individual or group of people could face if the committed these crimes:
