                    <h2>What is Javascript?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Javascript is a High level programming language that enables
                        you to create, add and implement various features to a webpage.
                        These features could include: animations, interactive maps or 
                        elements or even displaying content updates. This language is 
                        in addition to HTML and CSS on a webpage; is found within script tags.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Javascript is both an Event driven and Object Orientated Programming 
                        Language
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>What is an Event Driven Program?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Event Driven Programming is another programming paradigm, 
                        where the actual flow of the program, when it is executed, 
                        is dictated by the order of events/ triggers.  
                        These programs tend to be designed to detect the triggers 
                        and then execute a specific event handler.
                        These Triggers/ events can include:
                        •	Button clicks
                        •	Mouse movement
                        •	Timers
                        •	Electronically generated triggers
                        •	System events
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Event Driven programs can have a Graphical User Interface, 
                        but can also be developed without one. 
                        Invariably the program will allow you to design the GUI.
                    </p>

                    <h3>What is an Object Orientated Program?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Object Oriented programming is a programming model 
                        that is written and organised as classes and objects, 
                        that interact with each other. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In OOP, there is another principal called Encapsulation. 
                        This process groups data and the methods 
                        (that will be executed upon the data) into one class. 
                        This also provides security to the data stored within 
                        the class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        OOP allows the programmer to reuse code, via the class 
                        system (tries to promote it)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Today, the majority of modern games use OOP and 
                        to develop high security programs.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Light Weight Programming Language</h3>
                    <p>
                        Javascript is classed as a "Lightweight" programming 
                        language because it was created to only handle browser
                        data. Also, due to the language not having many sets of
                        libraries than a general purpose language, such as:
                        C# or Python, it therefore makes javascript lightweight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Javascript was also only created for client side execution
                        and use for web-applications.
