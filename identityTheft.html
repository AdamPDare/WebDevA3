                    <h2>What is Identity Theft</h2>
                    <p>
                        Identity theft is where an individual steals someones personal
                        information, to then use to commit fraudulent activities, usually
                        to gain financially. This information could be: name, address, date of birth
                        or even your bank details. People who do commit identity fraud do face 
                        very serious consequences, normally prison time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What are the common types of Identity Theft?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Driver Licence Fraud. This occurs when someone registers/ is in possession of a 
                        driving licence under someone elses name. This then allows them to potentially
                        commit various traffic or road violations, that could cause the person to lose 
                        their drivers licence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Financial Identity Theft. A criminal may have stolen someones personal information
                        to then take control of your bank accounts or create ones under your name. 
                        If this does occur to someone, it takes a long time for them to rectify the damage
                        that has been caused, such as: a poor credit score.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Child Identity Theft. This type of identity theft invariably is commited by a 
                        relative and they will acquire a loan or credit card under their child's or relatives
                        name. Since most children wont know what a band account is/ wont have a reason to check them
                        criminals can exploit this and easily complete fraudulent activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Change of Address. Fraudsters/ criminals can change your personal address to theirs
                        so they receive your mail and online purchases (potentially) rather than you.
                        This therefore enables them to see all your personal information, including your bank
                        details.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Employment Identity Theft. The unemployed, criminals and illegal immigrants may use 
                        stolen identification or personal information to acquire a job; hide their true
                        personal information and job history from their employers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Fraudsters/ Criminals may try to steal personal belongings or company equipment
                        to obtain sensitive information about the individual or company. For example: stealing
                        a company laptop or going through someones mail box to obtain bank statements. If they
                        do obtain the information they are looking for, normally they will try and gain 
                        from it financially, so contact your bank or organisation immediately.

                    <h3>Hacking</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hacking is where someone attempts to gain unauthorised access 
                        to data, computer or system, invariably with malicious intent
                        and to cause harm. They do this via exploting various weaknesses
                        or security holes in a system or network, for example: using 
                        an algorithm to crack a password. In this case, it is with the goal
                        to obtain sensitive information to then conduct fradulent activities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To prevent hackers from obtaining personal information:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        1. Encrypt your files
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. Install a firewall and anti-virus
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. Scan your device on a regular basis
